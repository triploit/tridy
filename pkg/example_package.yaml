name: "Tridymite"
decription: "Just a really short description."
information: |
"Here comes really long textes, that describe what you can do with this package,
maybe some help. Like a little man page. Or just create a man page for this
program, install it (as a product) and let the user know how to see the man page.

For example:

Install packages from GitHub, GitLab or other Git-Servers by using Tridymite!
Try it:

    sudo tridy install user:repo@server
    sudo tridy install triploit:tridymite@github.com

You can leave off the @server. GitHub is the standard Git server. So
also this will work:

    sudo tridy install user:repo
    sudo tridy install triploit:tridymite"


dependencies: # declaring dependencies
    - "user:repo@github"
    - "https://github.com/user/repo.git"

    - nopkg: # installing a repository (that is no tridymite package) with a shell command
        url: "https://github.com/user/repo.git"
        type: "command"
        arguments: "install.sh"

    - nopkg: # installing a repository (that is no tridymite package) via cmake
        url: "https://github.com/user/repo.git"
        type: "cmake"

products: # moving directories and binaries to their place
    - ./config_direcotry: "/usr/opt/program/config_directory"
    - ./binary: "/usr/opt/program/binary"

links: # linking files if necessary
    - /usr/opt/program/binary: "/usr/share/binary"
